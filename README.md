 Professional Data Science Certification - Property Rentals

 This repository contains my approach and presentation of the Case Study for the Professional Data Science Certification by Datacamp.
 The Case Study refers to a Property Rental company that has decided to develop a new application to attract more users to sign up to their website. The app aims to estimate the money that users would get for their property. A dataset with rental properties and their location, property type, room type, bathrooms, bedrooms, minimum nights and price was provided to analyse their features in common to be analysed.

 I was given 24 hours to prepare a technical report and a presentation to the product manager, which I then presented for 10 minutes with the support of the slides.
 The repository contains the original data as well as the Python notebook that I used to manipulate and analyse the data with the final presentation in a PDF format.
